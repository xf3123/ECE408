# ECE408/CS483 Final Project

## Introduction

This is the skeleton code for the Fall 2023 ECE408 / CS483 course project.

In this final project, you will be implementing and optimizing the forward-pass of a convolutional layer using CUDA. Convolutional layers are the primary building blocks of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are used in many machine learning tasks like image classification, object detection, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. In general, CNNs work well on tasks where the data/input features have some level of spatial relationship.

You will be working with a **modified** version of the LeNet-5 architecture shown below.

Your optimized CUDA implementation of the convolutional layer will be used to perform inference for layers C1 and C3 (shown in red) in the figure above. We will be leveraging the [mini-dnn-cpp](https://github.com/iamhankai/mini-dnn-cpp) (Mini-DNN) framework for implementing the modified LeNet-5. 

We will be using the [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist), where the inputs to the network will be a batch of 10,000 single channel images, each with dimensions of 86 x 86 pixels. The output layer consists of 10 nodes, where each node represents the likelihood of the input belonging to one of the 10 classes (T-shirt, dress, sneaker, boot etc.)

The overall learning objectives for this project are:
* Demonstrating command of CUDA and optimization approaches by designing and implementing an optimized neural-network convolutional layer forward pass
* Obtaining practical experience in analyzing and fine tuning CUDA kernels through the use of profiling tools like Nsight Systems (`nsys`) and Nsight-Compute (`nv-nsight-cu`)

You will be working on this project individually. We will release the code for project milestones one at a time.

*You are expected to adhere to University of Illinois academic integrity standards. Do not attempt to subvert any of the performance-measurement aspects of the final project. If you are unsure about whether something does not meet those guidelines, ask a member of the teaching staff.*

## Milestone 1: Rai Installation, CPU convolution, Profiling

***Deadline: 8 PM, Oct. 13, 2023***

For each milestone, you will also need to complete a report on Canvas. The table below contains all of the deliverables.

| Deliverables |
| ------------ |
| Create a CPU convolution implementation |
| Profile your implementation with `gprof` |
| Complete your report on Canvas: https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/34994/assignments/674251 |
| Use `rai -p <project folder> --submit=m1` to mark your job for grading |

### Testing Rai
Run the default Mini-DNN forward pass using rai without any CPU/GPU implementation.

Use RAI to run a batch forward pass on some test data.

    rai -p <project-folder> 


This will upload your project directory to rai and move it to `/src`, where the execution specified in `rai_build.yml` will occur. 

***Understanding rai_build.yml***

The `image:` key specifies the environment that the rest of the execution will occur in.
This environment includes the Mini-DNN framework as well as the model definition and pre-trained weights that will be used to do inference. **(Do not modify this entry)**

The `resources:` key specifies what computation resources will be available to the execution. **(Do not modify this entry)**

The `commands:` key specifies the recipe that rai will execute. First, the project files are copied to the `/build/student_code` directory so that we have a record of your code along with your performance.
Then the files in `custom` are copied to `/ece408/project/src/layer/custom` in the Mini-DNN source tree and the pretrained weights are copied to `/build`. Finally, Mini-DNN is recompiled with your custom code.

`./m1 100` runs the code specified in `m1.cc` program for a batch of 100 input images. 

You should see the following output:

    âœ± Running bash -c "./m1 100" 
    Running test case 1
    B = 1 M = 3 C = 3 H = 224 W = 224 K = 3 S = 1
    Test case 1 failed
    Running test case 2
    B = 2 M = 3 C = 3 H = 301 W = 301 K = 3 S = 2
    Mismatch at index 1 a = 5.39298 b = 5.7597
    Test case 2 failed
    Running test case 3
    B = 3 M = 3 C = 3 H = 196 W = 196 K = 3 S = 3
    Mismatch at index 1 a = 6.01963 b = 6.8114
    Test case 3 failed
    Running test case 4
    B = 4 M = 3 C = 3 H = 239 W = 239 K = 3 S = 4
    Mismatch at index 1 a = 5.23304 b = 4.04357
    Test case 4 failed

It is okay to fail these testcases here since you haven't implemented the convolutional layers yet. **Note if you did not pass the testcases, the DNN model won't be executed.**

Modify `rai_build.yml` to use `time` to measure the elapsed time of the whole program.

    - /bin/bash -c "time ./m1 100"

### Create a CPU Implementation

See the [description](#skeleton-code-description) of the skeleton code for a brief overview of what each file does.

Modify `custom/cpu-new-forward.cc` to implement the forward convolution described in Chapter 16 of the textbook.
The performance of the CPU convolution is not part of the project evaluation. We only evaluate for correctness.

The algorithm is also below, for your convenience

    for b = 0 .. Batch                     // for each image in the batch 
        for m = 0 .. Map_out               // for each output feature maps
            for h = 0 .. Height_out        // for each output element
                for w = 0 .. Width_out 
                {
                    output[b][m][h][w] = 0;
                    for c = 0 .. Channel   // sum over all input feature maps
                        for p = 0 .. K // KxK filter
                            for q = 0 .. K
                                output[b][m][h][w] += input[b][c][h * Stride + p][w * Stride + q] * k[m][c][p][q]
                }

Unlike the convolutions described in the class, note that this one is not centered on the input image. There is no padding and the length of strides has been given. The following illustration may help you visualize this better. In this case the stride is 1. 

![ConvExample](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-230/illustrations/convolution-layer-a.png?1c517e00cb8d709baf32fc3d39ebae67)

For a convolutional operation, the stride 
**S** denotes the number of pixels by which the window moves after each operation.

Modify `rai_build.yml` to invoke

    - /bin/bash -c "./m1"

Please be patient as the CPU implementation is slow and will take several minutes to run. (For instance, a correct implementation with 10k images may take 13+ mins to run). If you want to iterate quickly when developing code using smaller batch sizes, see [Specifying Batch Size](#specifying-batch-size). When your implementation is correct, you should see output like this:

    Running test case 1
    B = 1 M = 3 C = 3 H = 224 W = 224 K = 3 S = 1
    Running test case 2
    B = 2 M = 3 C = 3 H = 301 W = 301 K = 3 S = 2
    Running test case 3
    B = 3 M = 3 C = 3 H = 196 W = 196 K = 3 S = 3
    Running test case 4
    B = 4 M = 3 C = 3 H = 239 W = 239 K = 3 S = 4
    All test cases passed
    Test batch size: 1000
    Loading fashion-mnist data...Done
    Loading model...Done
    Conv-CPU==
    Op Time: XXXX.XX ms
    Conv-CPU==
    Op Time: XXXX.XX ms

    Test Accuracy: 0.886

Every time your layer is invoked, it will print the "Op Time," the time spent working on that layer.
Since the network has two convolutional layers, two times will be printed.
You can time the whole program execution by modifying `rai_build.yml` with

    - /bin/bash -c "time ./m1"

### Specifying Batch Size
`./m1`, `./m2`, `./m3` and `./final` all take one optional argument: the dataset size.  
If the correctness for each possible batch size is as below, you can be reasonably confident your implementation is right. The correctness does depend on the data size. 

For example, to check your accuracy on the full data size of 10,000, you could modify `rai_build.yml` to run

    - /bin/bash -c "./m1 10000"

| Number of Images | Accuracy  |
| -----------------| --------- |
| 100              | 0.86 |
| 1000             | 0.886 |
| 10000            | 0.8714 |

Note: Due to the limited capacity of our RAI servers, in order to ensure RAI job submissions take a reasonable amount of time, we are only requiring you to run and profile your CPU implementation with a batch size of 1000 images for this milestone.

### Use Gprof to profile your CPU implementation

You will use `gprof` to profile the execution of your CPU forward convolution implementation.

We compile and link your `cpu-new-forward.cc` with the `-pg` flag, which creates a `gmon.out` artifact containing profile information when the binary `m1` is executed.  To analyze this information in human readable form, modify `rai_build.yml` and modify the line to redirect `gprof` output as `outfile`.
 
    - /bin/bash -c "./m1 1000 && gprof -Q m1 gmon.out > outfile"

By default, `gprof` prints both a flat profile and a call graph (see "Interpreting gprof's Output" in the [GNU gprof Documentation](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/gprof/index.html)).  With the `-Q` flag, we only print the flat profile.  The information you need can be found near the beginning of `gprof`'s output. You can download your build folder and process the output `outfile` with `grep` (with your function's name) or `head`. You can also open it with text editor if you want to examine the complete output.

The provided `m1.cc` is identical to the one used by `--submit=m1`.

## Appendix

### Skeleton Code Description
`custom/cpu-new-forward.cc` and `custom/new-forward.cu` containes skeleton implementations for the CPU and GPU convolutions respectively. You can complete the project by modifying these two files only. `custom/cpu-new-forward.h` and `custom/gpu-new-forward.h` are the respective header files. You need not modify these files unless you need to declare your own functions.

The code in `m1.cc`, `m2.cc`, `m3.cc`, `m3_prof.cc` and `final.cc` are the top level files that are executed for each milestone. You should not be modifying these files.

### Checking for Errors

Within `custom/new-forward.cu`, you can use the predefined error handling code to catch CUDA errors or, you can define a macro/function similar to `wbCheck` used in WebGPU.

To catch memory errors, prepend your command with `cuda-memcheck`. 
Assume we want to check memory errors on Milestone3 binary, 
in your `rai_build.yml`, run 

    - /bin/bash -c "cuda-memcheck ./m3"
